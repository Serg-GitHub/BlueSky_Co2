BlueSky_Co2

You have been approached by Blue Sky Development and have been asked to develop an Android mobile version of their personal CO2 footprint calculator. Your brief is to develop a personal CO2 footprint calculator app for Android using the React Native framework and JavaScript. The App must be able to calculate a user's CO2 input based on lifestyle activities.

MVP

- Input values for various lifestyle activities, for example: Meat consumption, different commute methods, recycling, how much heating they use, holiday habits and more
- View their CO2 footprint displayed as a total average, calculated versus real world data.
- Update input values to see the effect on their CO2 footprint.
- View CO2 footprint data in a visually engaging manner.

To run the App install React Native Expo CLI using the command 'npm install -g expo-cli'. Once Installed run the command 'npm i' to download the necessary modules then run the command 'npm start' to start the App. Metro Bundler will load in your browser where you can select to run the App in your browser, use an AVD emulator or you can scan the QR Code which displays in your terminal or browser by downloading the Expo Go App which is available from the Playstore.

- Note: To use the AVD emulator you require Android Studio which is available here https://developer.android.com/studio
- Expo for Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_GB&gl=US
